## In order to use the WP_mock, you need to have phpunit installed globally
## For every new test, don't forget to require it in the bootstrap file
## and for running the tests use `phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php <MyTestFile.php>`
## You can create an alias, like in mac os, where `alias runphptests = phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php`, now you can `runphptests <MyTestFile.php>`
